This repository houses the final project for Chase Leibowitz's and Jacob Ominsky's senior year independent study at Shipley. 
The project uses a LSTM (long-short-term-memory) network to predict stock prices. The model is trained on GOOGL stock data.
As it stands right now, all of the code is in the main file and the CSV houses historical GOOGL stock data.
